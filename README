The format for converting xml to json is as follows. A tag is split into three
things a name referencing its tag name, its attributes, and its children. As
such, the format looks similar to: (Note: <> specify values that are arbitrary)

{name:"<tagname>", 
	attributes:{<attr1>:"<val1>", <attr2>:"<val2>", ...}, 
	children:[<child1>, <child2>]}

Children of a tag, may be a tag in which case the previous format is nested in 
the children array or is text, in which case the value is placed in quotes inside
the children array.
